It provides a platform for students to understand their potential end-of-semester marks based on current performance, and for administrators to manage student data, resources, and community interactions.‚ú® Key FeaturesFor Students üßë‚ÄçüéìAI-Powered Predictions: Enter previous semester marks, current class test scores, and attendance to receive real-time predictions for final exam results, generated by a Random Forest Regressor model.Personalized Dashboard: A central hub to access all features.Resource Hub: View and download subject-specific study materials (notes, PDFs, etc.) uploaded by administrators.Announcement Board: Stay updated with the latest announcements relevant to your specific branch and semester.Interactive Q&A Forum: Ask academic questions, post replies, and engage with peers and administrators in a community forum with voting features.For Administrators üë©‚Äçüè´Comprehensive User Management: View, search, edit, and delete student and other administrator profiles.Student Analytics Viewer: Access the prediction tool for any student to analyze their academic trajectory.Dynamic Model Training: Upload historical student performance data (CSV/Excel files) to train and update the prediction models for different branches and semesters.Content Management: Easily upload and manage study materials and post targeted announcements.Advanced Forum Moderation: Full control over the Q&A forum, including the ability to pin/lock threads, delete content, and block users from participating.üîß Technology StackBackend: Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemyMachine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPyFrontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScriptDatabase: SQLite‚öôÔ∏è Setup and InstallationFollow these steps to get the project running locally:PrerequisitesPython 3.8+GitInstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/visioned-predictor.git](https://github.com/your-username/visioned-predictor.git)cd visioned-predictorCreate and activate a virtual environment:On macOS/Linux:python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activateOn Windows:python -m venv venv.venvScriptsactivateInstall the required dependencies:Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:FlaskFlask-SQLAlchemywerkzeugnumpypandasscikit-learnopenpyxlThen, run:pip install -r requirements.txtRun the application:python app.pyOpen your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000.üõ†Ô∏è](http://127.0.0.1:5000.%F0%9F%9B%A0%EF%B8%8F) Configuration & UsageInitial SetupSecret Key: In app.py, change the app.secret_key from "your_secret_key" to a strong, unique secret.Admin Codes: The first time you run the app, default codes are set.Admin Signup Code: 1234Super Admin Code: 5678 (used in the admin profile to view/change the regular admin code).These can be changed in the Admin Profile page.How to UseAdministrator's Role:Sign up as an administrator using the default admin code.Go to the Material Uploader -> Upload Analytics Data tab.Read the guidelines, select a branch/semester, and download the CSV template.Fill the template with historical student data. The model requires this file to work. The file must have 16 columns in the correct order as specified by the template.Upload the completed CSV. The application is now ready to make predictions for that branch/semester.Optionally, upload study notes and post announcements.Student's Role:Sign up as a student.Complete your profile, making sure to select your correct Branch and Semester. This is crucial for accessing the right resources and predictions.Navigate to the Marks Predictor page.Enter your academic data into the form and submit to see your predicted marks.üñºÔ∏è Screenshots(Here you can add screenshots of your application)Student DashboardMarks Predictor PageAdmin User ManagementQ&A Forumüìú LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
